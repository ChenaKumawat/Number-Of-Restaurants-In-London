# Number-Of-Restaurants-In-London

In this case study, we aim to estimate the number of restaurants in London by analyzing the city's land use and infrastructure distribution. We divided London into several key areas: Residential (35%), Commercial (30%), Forest (10%), and Roads and Network (20%). Assuming London spans a 60x60 km² area, this results in approximately 300 km² dedicated to roads. This area is further divided into municipal roads (35%), state roads (50%), and central government roads (15%). The state roads are subdivided into main roads (30%), flyovers and highways (20%), and other roads (50%).

By examining these divisions, we can infer the density and distribution of restaurants in each area. Residential areas, making up 35% of London, likely host numerous local eateries, cafes, and small restaurants catering to the local population. Commercial areas, comprising 30% of the city, are expected to have a higher concentration of diverse dining establishments, ranging from fast food chains to high-end restaurants, driven by the demand from both workers and visitors in these bustling zones.

Road networks, although primarily serving transportation purposes, also play a crucial role in the placement of restaurants. Municipal roads, state roads, and central government roads each support different types of dining venues. Main roads and highways, for instance, are likely to have more roadside diners and rest stops, while flyovers might have fewer options due to their design. By synthesizing these insights, we can estimate the distribution and density of restaurants across London, providing a comprehensive overview of the city's dining landscape driven by its unique spatial and infrastructural characteristics.
